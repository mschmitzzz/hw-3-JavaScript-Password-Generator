# hw-3-JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Description

I have created a random password generator by modifying starter code using JavaScript to dynamically update HTML and CSS. It is meant to show my current understanding of HTML and CSS. When the user clicks on the "Generate Password" buttom, they are presented a series of prompts to determine the length of the password and which types of characters to use to create the password. Based on these inputs, a random string of characters is generated according to the selected criteria and the password is written onto the page.
